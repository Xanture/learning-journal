Day 2 at Code Fellows. I am enjoying my time here. Though I find the HTML and CSS tedious and not interesting. If this were a car I would want to build the engine, the fuel system and lay out the electrical work. I don't have much interest in what shape or color the body ends up being. Let artist worry about that. I am excited to work in groups and have more defined goals for larger projects. Perhaps being forced to do CSS and HTML more I'll discover something that I can relate to. I'm not holding my breath.

I hope we start functions soon so I can reach the pit of despair. Under pressure is where I like to be. Saying that, I hope I can put the money where my mouth is. At least the instructor is funny and engaging.

Day 3, for and while loops are fun. I was excited to be able to help my friends figure out how to use a for loop to take their user input and see if it matches something in their array. Today's lab was for sure challenging and i'm loving it. Still not too excited about CSS. I'm going to get some dinner and say late and make my website pretty.
