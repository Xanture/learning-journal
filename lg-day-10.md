# First learning journal entry
Day 2 at Code Fellows. I am enjoying my time here. Though I find the HTML and CSS tedious and not interesting. If this were a car I would want to build the engine, the fuel system and lay out the electrical work. I don't have much interest in what shape or color the body ends up being. Let artist worry about that. I am excited to work in groups and have more defined goals for larger projects. Perhaps being forced to do CSS and HTML more I'll discover something that I can relate to. I'm not holding my breath.

I hope we start functions soon so I can reach the pit of despair. Under pressure is where I like to be. Saying that, I hope I can put the money where my mouth is. At least the instructor is funny and engaging.

Day 3, for and while loops are fun. I was excited to be able to help my friends figure out how to use a for loop to take their user input and see if it matches something in their array. Today's lab was for sure challenging and i'm loving it. Still not too excited about CSS. I'm going to get some dinner and say late and make my website pretty.

Day 4. Functions!! Super excited to keep learning about functions. It was really great working in pairs for the lab. It was kinda funny that Izzy and I got paired up. How unlikely is that! Well we made a good team. I am eager to work with new people so I can get more out of my experience. Looking at tomorrows reading it looks like a full day of HTML / CSS. My page looks pretty bare right now but I am designing something fun at home. I'm going to try and get some time to work on it this weekend.

Day 5. Okay today was super awesome. I was having such hard time with arrays. The lab today really cleared up how to use arrays in ways I never thought. I am really loving this class. I can't wait for next week. I'm going to try and continue to work on my about me page. HTML/CSS design is where i'm struggling the most. Let's see if I can't work on it over the weekend.

Day 6. Feeling pretty good about object literals. Still getting my sea legs for this DOM stuff. I'm sure with enough practice i'll be flying in no time.   

Day 8. A little bummed I forgot to do an entry yesterday. The DOM is hard but i'm slowly getting it. I hope next week it's not so daunting. I get the basic idea of it, but in practice I still need more work. I think i'm at about where everyone else is more or less, which is nice. Megan has been a super huge help. I hope i'm able to return the favor some day, even if its for another student.

Day 10. I am so glad week 10 is over. I was a little bummed we ended it with some CSS project. I really need to practice more of it on my free time because it looks like it's going to be sticking around for a while. I just don't see myself doing this in my career. I wonder why Code Fellows doesn't have a art program where they teach web design. Then the students that just want to do software development can work on their code and then they can have group projects where members of both classes work together to create webpages. This week will be work work work work.
